Get road section. Holds a bunch of lanes going in the same direction. 
These lanes can only be connected to other road sections with the same amount of lanes.
(Maybe one more or one less?). These sections can be part of a larger group that hold
multiple sections that lay parralel to each other. By UI these can be split or changed.

Meshes generated by taking a lane group and choosing markings based on position.
